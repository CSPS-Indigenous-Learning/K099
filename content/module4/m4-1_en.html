  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_2"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_2"><p>Stereotyping happens when we think that all members of a group are the same. Even if most people in a group fit the stereotype, it is incorrect to apply it to all members of the group. For instance, it is possible that some Indigenous people are “spiritual.” But to say that all Indigenous people are “spiritual” is an overgeneralization. </p></div></section>
  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_3"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_3"><p>Unfortunately, we often carry on as if stereotypes are facts. The problem is that we form attitudes based on stereotypes, and these attitudes can lead to actions.</p></div></section>
  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_4"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_4"><p>We all hold stereotypes that affect how we feel about others and treat them. However, we are often unaware of the hidden influence of stereotypes in our daily lives. <strong>To become more aware and change how we behave, we need to examine and challenge our stereotypes</strong>. </p></div></section>
  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_5"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_5"><p>Indeed, many stereotypes are well-known and widely used, such as the following:</p></div></section>

    <li>toddlers have tantrums</li>
    <li>the elderly are frail</li>

  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_7"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_7"><p>You can probably think of people who confirm these stereotypes, but you may also be able to think of people who do not. We must allow for individuality among members of a group. <strong>We need to acknowledge that our stereotypes may be incorrect and recognize that they may be harmful.</strong></p></div></section>
  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_8"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_8"><p><strong>Mass media plays a powerful and harmful role in portraying Indigenous peoples in distorted ways.</strong> When we see them repeatedly over time, they become fixed in our minds and reinforces some of your beliefs. However, stereotypes can be <strong>inaccurate</strong> and can <strong>lead to prejudice and discrimination</strong> against the targeted person or group. </p></div></section>
  <section class="LOM-element" data-lom-element="text" id="LOM_el_9"><div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM_edit_9"><p>We tend to see things that confirm our beliefs and we fail to notice the things that do not. This is called “confirmation bias,” and it may explain why our beliefs are so hard to change.</p></div></section>
