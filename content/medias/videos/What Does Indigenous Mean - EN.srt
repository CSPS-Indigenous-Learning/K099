1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
If we go back
to the time of contact

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
and Europeans
coming over to the Americas,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,958
there has always
been this idea of

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,541
(and again, it is referred
to as the imaginary Indian)

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,791
the Indian that
was created by the Europeans

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,916
when they
came over to the Americas.

7
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:26,291
Part of that imagery, which
later turned into stereotypes,

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,875
part of that imaginary
Indian was the idea

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,250
that Indians were all the same.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,250
This universal idea
that there is a one.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,583
So, everybody from North
to Central to South America

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,833
who was there at the time
got one term: Indian.

13
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:50,250
There has always been a push
from that very first contact to

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,958
try to find a term, one umbrella
term, that describes all,

15
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,708
which has led to
incredible layers of complexity.

16
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:05,083
It requires a depth
of understanding, but history...

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
Again, that is like trying
to say, 'Well, if they were

18
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,625
all one, then I guess everybody
from England to Japan was one.'

19
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,708
They say, 'That is incredible.
Everybody was different and

20
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,125
there were thousands of nations,
languages and cultures.'

21
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,041
Well, yes.
It was true here too.

22
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:22,958
So the quest has always been
to find a singular term,

23
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:27,541
a singular umbrella term,
that describes all as one.

24
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,833
In the early 1950s,
it was Native.

25
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,541
Well, first it was Indian.
Then it was Native.

26
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,291
In the constitutional talks
it became Aboriginal.

27
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,333
Then there is status
and non-status.

28
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,291
And treaty.

29
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,166
First Nation.

30
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,000
So that search
for the latest umbrella term

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,750
is Indigenous.

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,583
Indigenous meaning
that we are still searching for

33
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:52,583
that one term that describes
all, but they will never fit.

34
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,333
We have that sort of
juxtaposition against there is

35
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,666
no one-size-fits-all,
and we always try to find

36
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,166
one size that fits all.

37
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,333
So the struggle to find
that one all-encompassing term

38
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,291
will probably continue.

39
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,083
The counter-trend to that
is to identify people

40
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,416
by their nations.

41
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:15,833
So whether you are Anishinaabe,
Haudenosaunee, Omgohomi,

42
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,125
however you want to do it,
the correct terminology,

43
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:22,208
from my perspective,
is to identify and to greet

44
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:27,375
or acknowledge people from
the nation that they come from,

45
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,625
as opposed to try to find
one term that describes all.

46
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,541
We have always tried
to shoehorn a very large piece

47
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,625
of information
into one particular...

48
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,666
Square peg, round hole.
It has never worked.

49
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,291
It probably never will work.

50
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,750
It doesn't mean
we stop that search.

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,208
But I said the more correct
terminology from my perspective

52
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,166
is one that acknowledges
the nation or the people

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,791
that they come from.

54
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,125
That usually
keeps you on safer territory.

55
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,791
A lot of people
asked me this question

56
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,541
after the
new government came in.

57
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,666
What is Indigenous, and is that
the appropriate term now?

58
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,041
People want to
be correct and so on.

59
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,875
I explained that it doesn't
necessarily include the Inuit

60
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,791
and other groups and so on.

61
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:15,916
So, when I introduce myself,
I identify myself as Algonquin.

62
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,833
I am a member
of the Algonquin Nation.

63
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:23,208
That is how I choose
to introduce myself,

64
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:28,875
but I don't put a lot of thought
or much care, actually,

65
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,291
into whatever I am described as.

66
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:38,166
First Nation,
Indigenous, Indian, status,

67
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,791
all of the above...

68
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,291
I have been called
all of the above.

69
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:46,875
What I suggested to people
who got really wrapped up

70
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,916
in this is to not err
too much into that because,

71
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:56,791
quite frankly, at the community
level, this is not a big deal.

72
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,125
It is a big deal
for those who want to be

73
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,458
overly politically-correct,
and I think recently

74
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:08,000
Indigenous has exemplified
the importance of the U.N. DRIP,

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,583
the international relationship
that we have promoted

76
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,500
on the world stage.
So it has its time,

77
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,083
but who knows 20 years from now
what we will be called?

78
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,125
[Laughter]
