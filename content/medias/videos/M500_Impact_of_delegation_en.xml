         <p begin="00:00:06.90" end="00:00:09.50">Each minister in the federal government is responsible</p>
         <p begin="00:00:09.50" end="00:00:13.23">for resource management within his / her department.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:13.23" end="00:00:15.60">However, it is impossible for one person</p>
         <p begin="00:00:15.60" end="00:00:18.63">to assume full management of an entire department.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:18.63" end="00:00:20.80">Ministers therefore appoint subordinates</p>
         <p begin="00:00:20.80" end="00:00:23.90">to exercise specific powers for which they will be accountable.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:24.46" end="00:00:27.83">This is commonly known as « delegation of authority »,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:27.83" end="00:00:30.23">as defined in the Financial Administration Act</p>
         <p begin="00:00:30.23" end="00:00:33.60">under Sections 32, 33, and 34.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:36.60" end="00:00:39.50">Delegation of authority ensures the sound governance of</p>
         <p begin="00:00:39.50" end="00:00:43.36">public resources, notably with respect to fiscal management.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:44.40" end="00:00:47.63">Generally speaking, managers are responsible for initiating</p>
         <p begin="00:00:47.63" end="00:00:49.66">and approving expenditures.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:49.66" end="00:00:52.93">They must have been granted the necessary authority to do so,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:52.93" end="00:00:54.90">and must respect the limits within which</p>
         <p begin="00:00:54.90" end="00:00:58.53">they are authorized to approve these expenditures or contracts.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:59.86" end="00:00:62.23">Some key rules govern the authority</p>
         <p begin="00:00:62.23" end="00:00:64.83">to sign financial documents:</p>
         <p begin="00:00:64.83" end="00:00:67.13">The minister (and the deputy minister)</p>
         <p begin="00:00:67.13" end="00:00:69.33">must delegate in writing.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:69.33" end="00:00:72.20">Authority is delegated to a position.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:73.10" end="00:00:75.73">The supervisor must appoint a person to exercise</p>
         <p begin="00:00:75.73" end="00:00:77.96">the delegated authority.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:79.20" end="00:00:81.83">An individual who has been delegated signing authority</p>
         <p begin="00:00:81.83" end="00:00:85.00">may not delegate it to another individual.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:85.86" end="00:00:88.33">An individual should not exercise more than one</p>
         <p begin="00:00:88.33" end="00:00:91.63">of the following authorities for the same transaction:</p>
         <p begin="00:00:91.63" end="00:00:96.26">transaction authority (authority to enter into contracts),</p>
         <p begin="00:00:96.26" end="00:00:98.50">certification authority,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:98.50" end="00:00:99.83">payment authority.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:101.26" end="00:00:104.43">And finally, an individual may not authorize a transaction</p>
         <p begin="00:00:104.43" end="00:00:107.40">from which he / she might benefit.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:109.16" end="00:00:112.56">Let&apos;s take a closer look at the expenditure process.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:112.56" end="00:00:114.50">There may be as many as six steps to ensure</p>
         <p begin="00:00:114.50" end="00:00:118.23">the proper governance of authority and accountability.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:118.23" end="00:00:121.70">The process starts with a request for goods or services.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:123.60" end="00:00:126.63">The first step is the authority to incur expenditures;</p>
         <p begin="00:00:126.63" end="00:00:129.43">for example, when a manager approves a training plan.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:130.43" end="00:00:133.76">Step 2 is the authority to carry out one or more specific</p>
         <p begin="00:00:133.76" end="00:00:137.30">functions related to the control of financial commitments.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:137.30" end="00:00:139.26">In other words, making sure that funding</p>
         <p begin="00:00:139.26" end="00:00:142.13">will be available to pay an account when it&apos;s due,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:142.13" end="00:00:145.53">before approving the transaction under Section 32.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:147.33" end="00:00:150.63">The third step is the authority to enter into contracts,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:150.63" end="00:00:153.16">including purchasing with an acquisition card.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:155.10" end="00:00:158.96">Step 4 is the receipt of goods or services.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:160.26" end="00:00:162.96">Then it must be certified that the work has been performed</p>
         <p begin="00:00:162.96" end="00:00:165.80">as required, services and supplies have been</p>
         <p begin="00:00:165.80" end="00:00:168.56">satisfactorily provided, and the payment complies</p>
         <p begin="00:00:168.56" end="00:00:170.73">with policy requirements.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:171.73" end="00:00:174.83">This certification authority represents Step 5</p>
         <p begin="00:00:174.83" end="00:00:177.73">and is referred to as Section 34.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:179.00" end="00:00:182.20">Finally, the sixth step is the authority to pay,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:182.20" end="00:00:184.13">pursuant to Section 33.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:184.13" end="00:00:187.00">This function is usually performed by a financial officer</p>
         <p begin="00:00:187.00" end="00:00:189.26">after reviewing the legality of payments</p>
         <p begin="00:00:189.26" end="00:00:192.53">and exercising all appropriate financial controls.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:193.66" end="00:00:196.46">All these steps aim to provide government with the assurance</p>
         <p begin="00:00:196.46" end="00:00:199.30">that expenditures are carried out in a responsible manner</p>
         <p begin="00:00:199.30" end="00:00:201.23">and that each stakeholder is accountable</p>
         <p begin="00:00:201.23" end="00:00:203.20">for his / her actions.</p>
