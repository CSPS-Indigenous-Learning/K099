00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:10,416
[Chants]

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,083
Within our Nation,
the Mohawk Nation,

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,416
there was
no language word for art.

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,833
We called it beauty.

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,000
It was a way of life.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,375
It was how we lived day to day,

7
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,458
and the path,
the path of beauty.

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,875
Cowboy Smithx.

9
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:37,458
Good to see you.

10
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,791
Good to see you again.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,041
I am glad you made it.

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,500
Yeah, well,
I am really happy

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,250
just to be here
on your land, you know.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,291
I have heard that before.

15
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,291
[Laughter]

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,875
Elder in the Making is kind
of a road trip story, actually,

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,666
between a Chinese Canadian (me)
and Cowboy Smithx,

18
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,500
as we go learning about
our shared history and our home.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,750
What started off as
kind of a small exploration

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,666
grew into a huge exploration
of Indigenous culture

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,750
and history
in Southern Alberta,

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,458
on the traditional
territories of Blackfoot.

23
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,458
Actually, you know,
shoot the beautiful landscapes

24
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,000
that exist out there
and understand what they mean

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,875
to the people of the land.

26
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,541
I can't even say it was
so close to home; it is home.

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,333
What is it that you would want
to tell us, the public servants,

28
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,041
on how we should be building
better relationships

29
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,375
with Indigenous peoples?

30
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,666
Making a genuine
connection with individuals,

31
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,958
specifically elders.

32
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,750
You know, they carry the most
knowledge in our communities.

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,041
It is really
a conversation about efforts.

34
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean, you have
got to go beyond what is

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
in your policy here,
at the School.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,083
I mean, you have got
to make it a personal journey

37
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,125
and not one that is part of
the institution you represent.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,458
You can't expect anything.

39
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,458
You can't think there is
a certain level you are going

40
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,750
to get to if you spend
four years with an elder.

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,833
It doesn't work that way.

42
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:03,083
Here is a dangerous conversation
about pan-Indianism.

43
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,166
We are not all the same.

44
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,375
We all have different
circumstances and connections

45
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,083
because the land itself,
the physical geography,

46
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,500
the geology, expresses itself
in different ways.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,708
Definitely, you have
to go above and beyond

48
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:24,166
what siloed expectations you
may have which may be connoted

49
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:29,875
to your work or connoted
to some sort of obligation.

50
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,208
Even tokenism is always
kind of a dangerous thing

51
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,625
to get involved with.

52
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,750
Definitely make it genuine,
make it authentic,

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,666
if you are going
to connect to somebody.

54
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,750
Know your history.

55
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,250
It is important to know
what you are actually saying

56
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,583
before you say it.
Be considerate, right?

57
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,916
So, when I hear things like,
'Well, we will let

58
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,250
the First Nations do
their dance at the beginning,

59
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,875
or we will let them...',
I mean, come on,

60
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,583
we are done being let in.

61
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:00,041
I mean, we are foreigners
in our own territory enough that

62
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,416
we don't need to be let anywhere
within our own territories.

63
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,708
So, when it comes
to the language of any type

64
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,541
of circumstance,
it is important to be

65
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,375
very aware
of what you are saying.

66
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:16,666
Inclusion is a form
of othering and it is...

67
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,333
You know,
I am saying to be respectful.

68
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,875
We are seeing all these types of
stories like Elder in the Making

69
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,666
and like the
Truth and Reconciliation Report,

70
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,666
which I recommend
everybody read.

71
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,333
These all help to start shaping
people's understanding

72
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,458
of how we came to where we are.

73
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,208
[Music]

74
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,708
It is essentially a love story.

75
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,375
It is about Annie,
who is a young, Indigenous girl

76
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,833
who is not
in touch with her culture.

77
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:52,791
She meets Gordon, who is
a survivor, and he teaches her

78
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,208
about the Indians
residential schools story.

79
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,458
I felt it was timely, and I felt
that art can bring about change.

80
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,541
I want to make people aware.

81
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,000
Truth brings reconciliation;

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,541
reconciliation, I think,
can bring harmony;

83
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,875
and harmony
can bring prosperity.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,541
Reconciliation is a word I have
only started using recently.

85
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,375
The fact that we are
even having this conversation

86
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,458
is quite inspiring.

87
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,708
Hopeful is definitely
a part of that,

88
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,000
but we have
been hopeful for too long.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,916
It is time to really take
agency over these conversations

90
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,708
and bring them into fruition.

91
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,041
We are not going to come
and say, 'Oh, it is time

92
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,041
to come to Mohawk lands'.

93
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,250
You know,
we are not going to do that.

94
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,041
It is not our place.

95
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,541
It is your place
to come and ask,

96
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,250
and it is in the asking

97
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,583
you will grow,

98
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,833
learn.

99
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:02,208
But more importantly,
love for ourselves and others.
