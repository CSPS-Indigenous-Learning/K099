    <h1>Situation #4</h1>
    <p>Within a short time, an Inuk public service employee lost two people from their community through suicide. The employee requested time off to visit the community and care for the families. The manager thought that the employee was taking too much time off for this reason and didn’t understand why the employee couldn’t continue to work.</p>
    <label for="situation1"><strong>How do you think the manager’s lack of support might affect the mental health of the employee? </strong></label>
    <textarea name="situation1" id="situation1" cols="70" rows="10" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></textarea>
    <p>A world view is the lens through which we see and experience the world around us. It influences our daily interactions with one another. At the end of the day, we may not always understand what another person has experienced because their world view is different.</p>
    <p>As a public service employee, you will come across many different people with many different world views. You may not understand these world views, but you need to respect them. You need to be aware that other people may experience the world differently.</p>
    <p><strong>Positive relationship building begins with an open mind and a willingness to listen and offer support. </strong></p>
