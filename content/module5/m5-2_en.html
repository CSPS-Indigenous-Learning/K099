                        <p>Some Indigenous people will not maintain eye contact. They may look over your shoulder or to the side of you. For those who attended residential schools, direct eye contact with church officials would often result in physical punishment.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reconciliation Through Art – Transcript</strong></p>
                        <p>---Chants</p>
                        <p>Within our Nation, the Mohawk Nation, there was no language word for art. We called it beauty. It was a way of life. It was how we lived day to day, and the path, the path of beauty.</p>
                        <p>Cowboy Smithx.</p>
                        <p>Good to see you.</p>
                        <p>Good to see you again.</p>
                        <p>I am glad you made it.</p>
                        <p>Yeah, well, I am really happy just to be here on your land, you know.</p>
                        <p>I have heard that before.</p>
                        <p>---Laughter</p>
                        <p>Elder in the Making is kind of a road trip story, actually, between a Chinese Canadian (me) and Cowboy Smithx, as we go learning about our shared history and our home. What started off as kind of a small exploration grew into a huge exploration of Indigenous culture and history in Southern Alberta, on the traditional territories of Blackfoot.</p>
                        <p>Actually, you know, shoot the beautiful landscapes that exist out there and understand what they mean to the people of the land. I can’t even say it was so close to home; it is home.</p>
                        <p>What is it that you would want to tell us, the public servants, on how we should be building better relationships with Indigenous peoples?</p>
                        <p>Making a genuine connection with individuals, specifically elders. You know, they carry the most knowledge in our communities. It is really a conversation about efforts. I mean, you have got to go beyond what is in your policy here, at the School. I mean, you have got to make it a personal journey and not one that is part of the institution you represent. You can’t expect anything. You can’t think there is a certain level you are going to get to if you spend four years with an elder. It doesn’t work that way.</p>
                        <p>Here is a dangerous conversation about pan-Indianism. We are not all the same. We all have different circumstances and connections because the land itself, the physical geography, the geology, expresses itself in different ways.</p>
                        <p>Definitely, you have to go above and beyond what siloed expectations you may have which may be connoted to your work or connoted to some sort of obligation. Even tokenism is always kind of a dangerous thing to get involved with.</p>
                        <p>Definitely make it genuine, make it authentic, if you are going to connect to somebody. Know your history. It is important to know what you are actually saying before you say it. Be considerate, right?</p>
                        <p>So, when I hear things like, ‘Well, we will let the First Nations do their dance at the beginning, or we will let them…’, I mean, come on, we are done being let in. I mean, we are foreigners in our own territory enough that we don’t need to be let anywhere within our own territories.</p>
                        <p>So, when it comes to the language of any type of circumstance, it is important to be very aware of what you are saying. Inclusion is a form of othering and it is… You know, I am saying to be respectful.</p>
                        <p>We are seeing all these types of stories like Elder in the Making and like the Truth and Reconciliation Report, which I recommend everybody read. These all help to start shaping people’s understanding of how we came to where we are.</p>
                        <p>---Music</p>
                        <p>It is essentially a love story. It is about Annie, who is a young, Indigenous girl who is not in touch with her culture. She meets Gordon, who is a survivor, and he teaches her about the Indians residential schools story.</p>
                        <p>---Music</p>
                        <p>I felt it was timely, and I felt that art can bring about change. I want to make people aware.</p>
                        <p>---Music</p>
                        <p>Truth brings reconciliation; reconciliation, I think, can bring harmony; and harmony can bring prosperity.</p>
                        <p>Reconciliation is a word I have only started using recently. The fact that we are even having this conversation is quite inspiring. Hopeful is definitely a part of that, but we have been hopeful for too long. It is time to really take agency over these conversations and bring them into fruition.</p>
                        <p>We are not going to come and say, ‘Oh, it is time to come to Mohawk lands’. You know, we are not going to do that. It is not our place. It is your place to come and ask, and it is in the asking you will grow, learn.</p>
                        <p>Right.</p>
                        <p>But more importantly, love for ourselves and others.</p>
                        <p>---Chants</p>
                        <p>I like the universal aspect of their language, which talks a lot about love, about connecting with your ancestors. That touches us as much as it does the Indigenous world, I would say.</p>
                        <p>I really thought that panel was absolutely incredible. I mean, it was really amazing seeing so many Indigenous and Non-Indigenous cultures kind of come together and really explain how really learning reconciliation can be made through art, and not just simply in terms of reading textbooks and being told things.</p>
                        <p>Among ourselves, we talked about how aware we were of each word.</p>
                        <p>After being able to meet them today, there is still an interest to go and look further.</p>
                        <p>---Chants</p>
                        <p>How do we make it through this reconciliation era? Is it going to be just a blip on the radar, or is it going to be part of the foundation that defines who we are for the next 150 years?</p>
