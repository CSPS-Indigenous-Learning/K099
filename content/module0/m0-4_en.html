                        <p>If we go back to the time of contact and Europeans coming over to the Americas, there has always been this idea of (and again, it is referred to as the imaginary Indian) the Indian that was created by the Europeans when they came over to the Americas. Part of that imagery, which later turned into stereotypes, part of that imaginary Indian was the idea that Indians were all the same. This universal idea that there is a one. So, everybody from North to Central to South America who was there at the time got one term: Indian.</p>

                        <p>There has always been a push from that very first contact to try to find a term, one umbrella term, that describes all, which has led to incredible layers of complexity. It requires a depth of understanding, but history… Again, that is like trying to say, ‘Well, if they were all one, then I guess everybody from England to Japan was one.’ They say, ‘That is incredible. Everybody was different and there were thousands of nations, languages and cultures.’ Well, yes. It was true here too. </p>

                        <p>So the quest has always been to find a singular term, a singular umbrella term, that describes all as one. In the early 1950s, it was Native. Well, first it was Indian. Then it was Native. In the constitutional talks it became Aboriginal.</p>

                        <p>So that search for the latest umbrella term is Indigenous. Indigenous meaning that we are still searching for that one term that describes all, but they will never fit. We have that sort of juxtaposition against there is no one-size-fits-all, and we always try to find one size that fits all.</p>

                        <p>So the struggle to find that one all-encompassing term will probably continue. The counter-trend to that is to identify people by their nations. So whether you are Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Omgohomi, however you want to do it, the correct terminology, from my perspective, is to identify and to greet or acknowledge people from the nation that they come from, as opposed to try to find one term that describes all.</p>

                        <p>We have always tried to shoehorn a very large piece of information into one particular… Square peg, round hole. It has never worked. It probably never will work. It doesn’t mean we stop that search. But I said the more correct terminology from my perspective is one that acknowledges the nation or the people that they come from. That usually keeps you on safer territory.</p>

                        <p>A lot of people asked me this question after the new government came in. What is Indigenous, and is that the appropriate term now? People want to be correct and so on. I explained that it doesn’t necessarily include the Inuit and other groups and so on. </p>

That is how I choose to introduce myself, but I don’t put a lot of thought or much care, actually, into whatever I am described as. First Nation, Indigenous, Indian, status, all of the above… I have been called all of the above. What I suggested to people who got really wrapped up in this is to not err too much into that because, quite frankly, at the community level, this is not a big deal. </p>
